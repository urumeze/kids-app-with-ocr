      "question": "Daniel reached home and gave his parents his Common Entrance Examination result slip. Thereafter, his father went to Metropolitan Grammar School and collected the school prospectus. He bought a box, locker, desk, chair, uniforms, sandals, books etc for him. Few days to the day Daniel was to report to the school, his parents gave him some useful advice and suggestions.\n'My son,' Daniel's father began as he cleared his throat, 'In a few days’ time, you will be leaving for the boarding school and I want you to know why you are going there.'\n'Without mincing words, you will be there to face your studies seriously in order to come out with a good result. Your mother and I are ready to make the necessary sacrifices and train you and your siblings up to the university.'\n'You have seen the type of life we are living. We work very hard but with little pay because we did not go to the university. I will not like any of my children to end up like us. Make good use of your time; be diligent in your studies knowing full well that there is no formula for success in life except working hard.'\n'My dear son,' added his mother, 'Avoid bad friends and gangs because evil communication corrupts good manners. Move with the right friends from whom you can copy good things.'"

      "passage": "Poor Kim lost his left hand in a terrible accident. His parents could console him. To cheer him up his father made him join a judo school. As the boy always wanted to learn judo, his father thought that this would make him happy.\nEveryone wondered how a boy with only one hand could learn judo. However, the master happily enrolled him. He trained in judo for about 8 months and practiced nothing but a single stroke. He trained for all 8 months in mastering a single stroke. The boy was surprised and sometimes annoyed that his master taught him only one stroke; yet he said nothing.\nThe boy mastered the stroke and grew in it as nobody else could excel in doing that particular stroke. The boy was picked by the master to compete at the national level judo championship. Everyone made fun of Kim and the master. They wondered how someone with only one hand could win a national championship.\nTo everybody's surprise, Kim easily defeated his six opponents with his single stroke. He gradually moved to the semi-finals and eventually made it to the finals. When the final match began, the opponent was so strong that Kim could not counter attack him. The referee decided to halt the match, as the opponent could harm Kim severely. The referee announced a break and discussed with Kim's master to stop the match and declare the opponent winner of the championship.\nEven Kim agreed to the referee's suggestion to stop the match and was happy that he had advanced very much in the championship. However, his master did not want him to quit the match. He asked him to continue the match after much persuasion. Eventually, Kim won the contest and was declared the champion."
