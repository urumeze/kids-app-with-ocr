        "passage": "Yoghurt has deep roots in history. It has been enjoyed in many cultures for a long time. It is traditionally made by adding warm milk and a small amount of already made yoghurt. This type of yoghurt is a delicious snack in many homes around the world. Many cultures consume yoghurt as a condiment or as an accompaniment to spicy foods.\nIn Western cultures, yoghurt is considered to be a delicious healthy food with beneficial bacteria that aids digestion and satisfies cravings without any form of guilt. Greek yoghurt is popular and considered as one of the best yoghurt one can choose when shopping for yoghurt. Greek yoghurt is very healthy because the whey has been strained out and what is left is a creamy and protein rich treat.\nThese days, people are becoming increasingly aware of the potential health benefits of fermented foods, such as yoghurt. The reason being that, some fermented food contains probiotics, especially yoghurt.\nProbiotics are good bacteria that the body can benefit from which are found in yoghurts, especially traditionally processed yoghurt."

The wolf is chasing the sheep!'\nWhen the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when he saw their angry faces. 'Do not scream boy,' warned the villagers, 'when there is no wolf!' They angrily went back down the hill.\nLater, the shepherd boy cried again, 'Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!' To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.\nAs they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, 'Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Do not cry wolf when there is no wolf!' But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.\nLater, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around the flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, 'Wolf! Wolf!' But the villagers thought he was fooling them again so they didn't come to help.\nAt sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who had not returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping. 'There really was a wolf! The flock is gone! I cried out 'wolf!' but you didn't come,' he wailed.\nAn old man comforted him saying, 'Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!'"
