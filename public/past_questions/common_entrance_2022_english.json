      "question": "A good night sleep is very important for your health. Your brain and your body use that time to do all kinds of things that they cannot do when you are awake. Many experts say that children need about ten hours of sleep per night. Sometimes it is not easy to fall asleep quickly; you may have a lot of energy or be excited or worried about something. You can make it easier to sleep by: keeping a steady bedtime routine, doing calming activities before bed, limiting caffeinated drinks, turning off the TV, avoiding scary shows near bedtime, exercising during the day (but not right before bed), and using your bed only for sleep. If you follow these tips, it will be easier for you to fall asleep and stay asleep."

      "question": "Poor Kim lost his left hand in a terrible accident. His parents could not console him. To cheer him up, his father made him join a judo school. As the boy always wanted to learn judo, his father thought that this would make him happy.\nEveryone wondered how a boy with only one hand could learn judo. However, the master happily enrolled him. He trained in judo for about 8 months and practiced nothing but a single stroke. He trained for all 8 months in mastering a single stroke. The boy was surprised and sometimes annoyed that his master taught him only one stroke; yet he said nothing.\nThe boy mastered the stroke and grew in it as nobody else could excel in doing that particular stroke. The boy was picked by the master to compete at the national level judo championship. Everyone made fun of Kim and the master. They wondered how someone with only one hand could win a national championship.\nTo everybody's surprise, Kim easily defeated his six opponents with his single stroke. He gradually moved to the semi-finals and eventually made it to the finals. When the final match began, the opponent was so strong that Kim could not counter-attack him. The referee decided to halt the match, as the opponent could harm Kim severely. The referee announced a break and discussed with Kim's master to stop the match and declare the opponent the winner.\nEven Kim agreed that the match should stop and was happy that he had advanced so far in the championship. However, his master refused and encouraged him to continue. Eventually, Kim won the contest and was declared the champion."
