    "question": "Theatre in the recent past used to be a very popular art in traditional African society. It used to be a point of intersection where members of the community not only come to entertain themselves, 'but join heads together'. In the traditional context of African drama, theatre was a popular and respectable institution which preserved the people's culture and tradition. Theatre was popular with the people because it emphasized community participation, peace and progress. Presentations focused on the people's lives, their aspirations, fears, and hopes. But today, the situation is different. Theatre is becoming very unpopular.\n\nAfrica of the present age is pre-occupied with many problems yearning for immediate solutions. The continent is facing hydra-head challenges on the political, social, and economic scenes. In a world where Science and Technology are seen as the solutions to these problems, little attention is paid to the arts. Literature generally, and drama in particular is often rated very low on the utility-scale. Many Africans today look at drama and theatre as a mere thing of fun, a joke so to say.\n\nElitism is another barrier that militates against the appreciation of theatre as a communal art. Folk theatre is appreciated by a negligible number of people, contemporary focus is on literary theatre. Unfortunately, literary theatre only pretends to serve the interest of its society while in reality, it has a foreign audience in mind. The use of European and American theatrical conventions by academic playwrights can bear witness to this anomaly.\n\nThe popularity of literary African theatre is further marred by the medium of communication as most literary dramas in Africa are written in foreign languages which are not understood by many Africans. The question often asked is whether the artist should climb down to the level of his community or stay at his exalted height and wait for the community to gradually move up to him.",

    "question": "The financing of the university will always be a vexatious problem not only because of the need for it to maintain a level of independence that allows for the thriving of intellectual pursuit but also for the size of the funding that is required to maintain an acceptable level of infrastructure in a modern university. The experience of the Nigerian university in recent years has been almost alarming. The funding levels required constitute sufficient reasons for diversifying the sources. Even if the government was in a position to meet all of the university's financial requirements, it is desirable that every effort be made to reduce such contribution in the interest of university autonomy. The university should seek to become dependent, in a substantial way, on funds generated from within. The sources of funding the university should be diversified as much as possible. We can identify four sources - government, industry, students, and individual philanthropists. Each source has its own set of problems which ought to be addressed.",
