      "passage": "There was famine in the land. The wise old fox was very hungry. He met a lean dog on the way. They wandered everywhere in search of food. At last, they spotted a farmhouse, but the door was locked. Soon, they caught a rat trying to enter the farmhouse. The rat sobbed and pleaded that they should spare his life. The rat soon bore a hole under the door. The three friends were soon eating hungrily inside the farmhouse. The fox ate and peeped through the hole repeatedly. Not quite long the farmer returned. The rat was the first to run out. The farmer pursued the rat with a stick. The fox squeezed himself through the hole and escaped. The greedy dog could not pass through the hole. He was caught by the farmer and tied with a strong cord on the neck."

      "passage": "There lived in a village a poor but worthy farmer who had to support himself, a wife and seven children on the returns of his small farm. One day, when walking through the fields and thinking of how he could add to his small income, he found a purse of gold which had been dropped by some passers-by. He carried it home and showed it to his wife who advised him to use it or at least a part of it in helping them out of their difficulty. The honest farmer reminded his wife that honesty was the best policy, and refused to use any of the money until he had done his best to find its owner. After a short time, he found that the purse belonged to a wealthy 'Zemindar' who lived in the neighbourhood and gave it back to him, receiving no other reward than the thanks of the owner. When the farmer's wife heard of the way her husband had been treated, she reproached him for his excessive honesty. The man only kept on saying 'honesty is the best policy'. A few months afterwards, the poor but honest farmer received an invitation to dine with the Zemindar whose money he found. After entertaining him, the Zemindar gave him a reward of N200,000.00 and told him that because of his honesty he had been appointed as the overseer of his land on a good salary."
